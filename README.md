Project based learning. 
Trying to increase my knowledge and practice coding in python through building chess in python
This project is still under development. 
End goal:
1) Build chess that allows a player to play against the computer or another player. 
2) Have a file/database that stores the moves by both the players.
3) Try to learn more about AI and how I can incorporate it into this project.
4) Add features to customize the board, chess pieces, and add time limits for players.
