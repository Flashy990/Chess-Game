I have been working on this project and a few others over the winter break. My goal with this project is to increase my skills in python through building the game of chess.

This project is still under development. 

End goal:
1) Build chess that allows a player to play against the computer or another player. 
2) Have a file/database that stores the moves by both the players.
3) Try to learn more about AI and how I can incorporate it into this project.
4) Add features to customize the board, chess pieces, and add time limits for players.
